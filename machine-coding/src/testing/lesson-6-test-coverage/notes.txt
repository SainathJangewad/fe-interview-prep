Here's the formatted and **interview-friendly** version of your notes on **Test Coverage in Vitest**:

---

## ✅ What is Test Coverage?

**Test coverage** measures how much of your code is executed when running your test suite.
It helps identify:

* 🟢 Which lines of code are tested
* 🔴 Which lines are untested (potential bugs)
* 📊 Overall test quality

---

## 📘 Types of Coverage Metrics

* **Statements** – Are all statements executed?
* **Branches** – Are all `if/else` paths covered?
* **Functions** – Are all functions invoked?
* **Lines** – Are all lines of code run?

## 🧪 How to Check Test Coverage in Vitest

### 1️⃣ Install Required Dependency

#### ➤ For `v8` (recommended for speed):

```bash
npm install -D @vitest/coverage-v8
```

#### ➤ For `istanbul` (for advanced features):

```bash
npm install -D @vitest/coverage-istanbul
```

---

### 2️⃣ Configure `vitest.config.ts` (or `vite.config.ts`)

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    coverage: {
      enabled: true, // Enable coverage
      provider: 'v8', // or 'istanbul'
      reporter: ['text', 'html', 'json'], // Output formats
      // include: ['src/**/*.ts'],
      // exclude: ['node_modules/', 'dist/'],
    },
  },
});
```

🔸 `reporter`: Defines coverage output

* `text`: Summary in terminal
* `html`: Interactive HTML report
* `json`: Structured coverage data

---

### 3️⃣ Run Tests with Coverage

```bash
npx vitest run --coverage
```

✔️ Shows a terminal summary
🌐 For HTML report: Open `coverage/index.html` in your browser

---

## 🖥️ Optional: View Coverage in Vitest UI

```bash
npx vitest --ui
```

📌 Works only if:

* `coverage.enabled = true` in config
* `html` reporter is set

---

## 🎯 Interview Keywords

> Say these to show practical knowledge:

* ✅ "Test coverage improves confidence in code"
* ✅ "Vitest uses `c8` under the hood for coverage"
* ✅ "Helps detect dead code and untested edge cases"
* ✅ "I aim for high branch and line coverage but also care about meaningful tests"
