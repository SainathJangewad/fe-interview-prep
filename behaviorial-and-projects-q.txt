1) Tell me about yourself
-> I'm a frontend developer with 2.5 years of experience, and I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I previously worked at Arraypointer as a React developer, where I was responsible for building and maintaining various web applications — including e-commerce platforms, e-learning websites, and other responsive, user-facing pages. My work involved working with React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Redux, and API integrations.Now that I’ve moved on from Arraypointer, I’m looking for new opportunities where I can take on more challenging frontend work and continue growing.

2) Do u have any Q for us?
->Can you tell me a bit about the company culture and what it’s like working ?


3) ur strengths and weakness?
->
strengths:
Quick learner:
"I pick up new tools and concepts quickly. For example, when I started working at my last job, I learned Redux and TypeScript on the go, which helped me contribute faster to projects."

Weakness:
Asking for help:
"Sometimes, I try to solve problems on my own for too long instead of asking for help early. I’m working on recognizing when collaboration can save time and improve results."

4)Why left prev company?

1)Tell us about ur project i.e. myfamilymart.in 
-> I worked on building an e-commerce app similar to Blinkit, which allows users to quickly order groceries online. My role was the frontend developer, and I used React to build responsive UI components. I implemented features like product browsing, filtering, a shopping cart, user login/logout, and real-time order tracking. For state management, I used Redux, and integrated with REST APIs for all backend data. One challenge was ensuring fast load times even with many products, so I used lazy loading and code splitting to optimize performance. The app handled high traffic well, and users found the interface easy to use.
